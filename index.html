    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>My name is Anthony Robinson, I grew up in a small town in King County called North Bend.
      I grew up playing in the woods, biking, hiking, skiing, and generally anything else related to the
      outdoors which is what my town had to offer. My parents were avid skiers and being not 30 minutes
      away from the mountain pass, we spent a lot of time there. I met one of my close friends on the ski
      bus which is about when i began to become really interested in computers. We were gamers and being
      that we began talking about pc hardware configurations, game modifications and of course the games themselves.
      Fast forward today and I've been an avid gamer, techy, and aspiring programmer.<p>
